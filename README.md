# AWS-Projects

## Overview
Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services especially servers, data storage, networking and computing power without direct active management by the user. It is renting resources on another company's computers which is only paid for what is used.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is dominant in cloud computing due to its flexibility, reliability, scalability, user-friendly interface, and cost-effectiveness. AWS provides a comprehensive range of cloud solutions, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).

In this repository I demonstrate projects that I have successfully implemented in a production environment.
I'm emphasizing AWS experience for future reference as a Cloud Engineer. I've documented the latest market architecture with configuration steps in my notes, presenting projects concisely to highlight my skills.

Together, these projects put together will result in a system that will become a reference for Cloud Engineers to troubleshoot and implement their own projects.
